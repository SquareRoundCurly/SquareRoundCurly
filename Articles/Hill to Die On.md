### I. Care for a game of chess?
When I was young, we had a cabin in the middle of nowhere, a quiet place tucked into the hills of rural Eastern Europe. I've spent most of my childhood summers there with my grandparents. There were few things to do, especially before the personal computer, smartphones and the internet were commonly available to the masses. The Eastern Bloc always lagged behind in technological adaptation, with a long history from the 1950s [CoCom embargo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_computer_hardware_in_Eastern_Bloc_countries) to the late adoption of the personal computer (PCs) in the early 2010s. I was too young to appreciate the serenity of nature and craved excitement and action as any young boy would.

My grandfather offered some escape from my boredom: a game of chess. I didn’t know how to play, and to make matters worse, he insisted we play **for a bet**. I was a young boy, of course I had no money of my own, but my grandfather had devised a plan: He knew I’d ask my grandmother for a few coins, allowing him to slowly siphon enough money to buy himself a beer or two when we went fishing on the weekend. **Of course my grandma knew of his schemes, but went with it anyways.**

At first, I stood no chance. Not only did I not know how to play, I didn’t even know the rules. My grandfather revealed them piece by piece, teaching me through each loss. Eventually, there were no more "new rules," and I felt I had mastered the game. But knowing the rules was not the same as knowing how to win, it was only a requirement to even have a chance. 
I copied his strategies, only to watch him adapt, predicting my every move. My win rate hovered around 5%. Whenever I managed to checkmate him, it was an incredible thrill — an anomaly, statistical noise.

Frustration built. My chances of winning were nowhere near 50%, and that felt fundamentally unfair. It was **absurd** to ask me for another round of chess, especially for a wager, when I had lost 10 times in a row. Sometimes, I refused to play at all, admitting defeat before the first move. But boredom is an excruciating pain it turns out, especially for a young boy.

Infamously, [James Olds and Peter Milner (1954) research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/13233369/) showed that rats would rather get shocked instead of facing boredom. Later in 2014, another journal [Just think: The challenges of the disengaged mind](https://dtg.sites.fas.harvard.edu/WILSON%20ET%20AL%202014.pdf) showed, that humans would rather inflict pain upon themselves than be left alone with their thoughts for 15 minutes. And I caved to my grandfather too. I kept playing. Not because I thought I could win, but because there was nothing else to do.

Years passed, and as it turns out, I was improving—slowly, but steadily. A child's perception of time couldn't allow me to extrapolate my improving win rate into the future to such a span. I've came up with strategies that my grandfather simply did not foresee, much less teach me. By the time I started winning consistently, the wagers mysteriously stopped. I've invented metrics to track my progress, and to my delight, I was improving.

After some time, I no longer cared about winning or losing. I had started to enjoy the game for its own sake. The game was a pleasant distraction, the outcome meaningless. Grandpa would talk to me about his memories, politics, woodworking, history, and work I could help him with in the garden. Games would reset during our discussions, returning our positions back to square one. But I've enjoyed it, regardless I've won or not. The game was never about winning or improved metrics.

### II. The Myth of Sisyphus
In Greek mythology, Sisyphus was condemned to an eternal struggle — pushing a boulder up a hill, only to watch it roll back down, over and over again. His defiance, trickery but ultimately, his hubris of disturbing the natural order in the face of Zeus was the end of him. There was no progress, no resolution — only repetition.

I, too, felt Sisyphusian, stuck in a cabin on a hill, playing a game I could never seem to win. But where I had the luxury of improvement, Sisyphus did not. His labor was static, a loop with no end. And in the end, even winning at chess did not *solve* the game — once I won, the only thing left to do, was to reset the board and play again. To improve.

For millennia, Sisyphus has been seen as the embodiment of human struggle. Lucretius likened him to politicians, forever chasing power, only to be cast down. Welcker saw him as the scholar, revealing only how much remains unknown. Modern psychology speaks of Sisyphusian labor to describe the crushing weight of meaningless work.

But for Albert Camus, Sisyphus is no tragic figure. He is a **rebel** (needless to say Camus was french). Camus presents three responses to the absurd:
1. **Suicide** – The ultimate rejection of an indifferent universe.
2. **Philosophical suicide** – Clinging to religion or false meaning as an escape.
3. **Revolt** – Acknowledging the absurd, embracing it, and pushing anyway.

According to Camus' The Myth of Sisyphus, Sisyphus does not push his boulder hoping for escape. He does not seek a reward. He pushes because he chooses to. And in that choice, he is free.

> “The struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man's heart.”  
> _One must imagine Sisyphus happy._

### III. A machine could never do that
*Mechanical Turk (A Török)*
![Mechanical Turk (A Török)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/Racknitz_-_The_Turk_3.jpg/1024px-Racknitz_-_The_Turk_3.jpg)

It was clear that the more games we played with my grandfather, the better I got. Diminishing returns were apparent when in my teenage years I enrolled in chess competitions, and I had faced much, much better players of the same age or even younger. It is clear that many of my opponents have trained much more for the competitions, and many had much greater talent too. 

But what if I could play not just dozens, or hundreds, but millions of games? What if I had centuries instead of summers, and memory to recall it all?

In 1770, Wolfgang von Kempelen (Kempelen Farkas) constructed a machine capable of playing chess (and perform the knight's tour). Supposedly fully mechanical automaton, it was a marvel constructed to impress Empress Maria Theresa. Of course it was all a ruse, having an operator sit inside the machine, actually playing chess. However, it was a successful hoax, Kempelen successfully toured the machine for 84 years. While the mechanical marvel was constructed on lies, I always found it so profound that to make a machine that can perform complex tasks like a human, you had to place the human spirit - literally in this case - in the box.

In the mid 20th century it was a common skepticism that **computers could never beat a human** - the best of humans to be exact - **in a game of chess**. At the dawn of the 21st century, IBM’s Deep Blue defeated world chess champion Garry Kasparov (1997), proving that AI could not only play chess but also surpass human ability.

AI research focused on chess because its well-defined rules and branching factor (average of **~35** legal moves per position) made it more approachable for brute-force search. Go, in contrast, has an average branching factor of **250+**, making traditional AI search methods infeasible.

The sentiment changed. **Sure, a computer can play chess, but a computer could never master Go as it did with chess!** The complexity increase from brute-forcing chess to brute-forcing Go is exponential, making traditional brute-force approaches infeasible for Go.

How infeasible? The key complexity measures:
1. **Branching Factor**: The number of possible moves per turn.
2. **Game Tree Complexity**: The total number of possible games.
3. **State-Space Complexity**: The number of legal board positions.

| Game           | Average Branching Factor | Positions (3 moves ahead) | Game Tree Complexity (Estimated) | State-Space Complexity |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Chess**      | ~35                      | $35^3 = 42,875$           | $10^{120}$                       | $10^{47}$              |
| **Go (19x19)** | ~250                     | $250^3 = 15,625,000$      | $10^{360}$                       | $10^{170}$             |
**1. Branching Factor:** In chess, a player typically has ~35 legal moves per turn. In Go, a player has ~250 legal moves per turn (early game), which remains high for much of the game. This means that if you brute-force a position **3 moves ahead**, you'd have: $35^3$ vs $250^3$ possible positions!
**2. Game Tree Complexity (Total Possible Games):** The number of possible chess games is estimated to be $10^{120}$ (Shannon Number). The number of possible Go games is around $10^{360}$, which is far larger than the number of atoms in the observable universe (~$10^{80}$). This makes brute-forcing Go completely infeasible.
**3. State-Space Complexity (Number of Board Positions):** Go's state-space complexity is vastly larger than chess, meaning the number of valid board positions is exponentially higher.

Deep Blue defeated Kasparov in chess using clever brute-force search with hand-tuned heuristics because the branching factor (~35) made searching a few moves ahead feasible. They used a technique (alpha-beta pruning) to eliminate bad moves, reducing the number of nodes to evaluate. It also had an endgame database that allowed perfect play in simplified positions.

For Go, brute force is **impossible** because the branching factor makes deep search intractable. Also, there is no clear material advantage (like chess pieces); Go relies more on global board evaluation, which is harder to quantify mathematically.
### IV. Move 37
AlphaGo’s triumph over Lee Sedol in 2016 was more than just an AI milestone — it was an existential shift. Chess had already fallen to machines in 1997, but Go was different. Its vast complexity made previous techniques infeasible, and Go masters believed that intuition, creativity, and deep pattern recognition were essential — things AI could never replicate.

And yet, on March 9, 2016, in the first of five games, AlphaGo defeated Lee Sedol.  
A defining moment came in Game 2, Move 37 — a move no human would have played.

Move 37 seemed incomprehensible at first. It violated conventional wisdom, defied decades of Go strategy. Commentators assumed it was a mistake. But as the game progressed, it became clear — this was a stroke of brilliance. AlphaGo saw something no human had. Lee Sedol, visibly shaken, left the room for 15 minutes to compose himself. He went on to lose the game.

For many, this was the end of an era. For Lee Sedol, it was something else. In Game 4, facing a nearly perfect opponent, Sedol played Move 78 — his own creative masterpiece. A move so beautiful, so unexpected, that even AlphaGo faltered. For one moment, a human had surprised the machine. He won that game.

This was the first and last time a human would ever beat AlphaGo.  
Lee Sedol had his victory, but the tide was unstoppable. A year later, **AlphaGo Zero** arrived, trained without human data — learning entirely through self-play. It crushed the original AlphaGo 100 games to 0.

Unlike Deep Blue, which brute-forced chess through raw computation, AlphaGo played like a human — only better. It developed instincts, patterns, and play styles that even grand-masters found alien. It dreamed its own strategies into existence, replaying millions of games against itself, exploring paths no human had ever walked.

Go was not just a game — it was a thousand-year-old measure of human intuition. It was a bastion of what a computer could never, in a million years compute. And AlphaGo had rewritten it in a single year.

Lee Sedol retired from professional Go shortly after. "Even if I become the number one human," he admitted, "there is an entity that cannot be defeated."
But he also saw something profound:

> _"Maybe it can show humans something we've never discovered. Maybe it’s beautiful."_

### V. Care for 44 million games of chess?
It took me years to reach a 50% win rate against my grandfather. Countless games, slow refinements, and trial and error. I improved because I sought victory. I no longer believed facing him was futile. Once I realized that the more we played, the better I became, I started nagging him for more matches. My poor grandfather, even in retirement, still had responsibilities and a senior job, while I had entire summers to waste.

But what if I had played not dozens, or hundreds, but millions of games?  
What if I had centuries instead of summers, and a perfect memory to recall it all?

In 2017, DeepMind released a [preprint paper](https://www.idi.ntnu.no/emner/it3105/materials/neural/silver-2017b.pdf) on AlphaZero, an AI system capable of mastering Go, Shogi, and Chess. The numbers are staggering:
- In its first **9 hours**, AlphaZero played **44 million games of chess against itself**.
- By **Hour 2**, it had already surpassed any human.
- By **Hour 4**, it was defeating **Stockfish**, the strongest chess engine in the world.
- By **Hour 9**, it had surpassed centuries of human chess theory.

AlphaZero had no teachers, no opening books, no databases of famous games. It learned chess the way I did (the rules were pre-programmed) — by playing, failing, refining, and improving. Only it played at a speed no human could ever match.

Its architecture was deceptively simple: a neural network for pattern recognition and a Monte Carlo Tree Search for decision-making. At first, it played like a novice, making random moves. But each iteration refined its instincts, filtering good moves from bad ones, sculpting its style.

It played not like a machine, but like a master. It sacrificed material for activity, launched deep positional attacks, played boldly, fearlessly, creatively—an entity without fear of loss, playing for the pure pursuit of excellence.

Even Garry Kasparov, who had spent decades facing AI opponents, was astonished:
> "The conventional wisdom was that machines would approach perfection with endless dry maneuvering, usually leading to drawn games. But in my observation, AlphaZero prioritizes piece activity over material, preferring positions that, to my eye, looked risky and aggressive.  
> Programs usually reflect the priorities and prejudices of programmers, but because AlphaZero programs itself, I would say that its style reflects the truth."

For years, we believed that AI would play mechanically—exploiting brute-force computation, calculating deeper but never _understanding_. Yet, AlphaZero **felt** different. It had discovered, from nothing, the same strategies that grandmasters had uncovered over centuries — along with moves no human had ever imagined.

What's more, it showcased a much more generalized knowledge; it not only bested Kasparov, but also knew how to play Go and Shogi like no human.
### VI. **What If Sisyphus Refused?**
Sisyphus is doomed to push the boulder for eternity — but what if he simply stopped? What if he let the rock sit at the base of the hill and walked away?

Ancient mythology rarely entertains this question. Sisyphus does not stop because that is not what Sisyphus does. Maybe he is compelled by the gods. Maybe he believes he can win. Maybe he continues out of habit, delusion, or some deeper, unspoken reason.

But once, something strange happened. When Orpheus descended into the underworld to retrieve Eurydice, he played a song so hauntingly beautiful that it moved even the most tormented souls of Hades. The Furies wept. The wheel of Ixion slowed. Even Tantalus, forever reaching for water that receded from his grasp, forgot his thirst. And **Sisyphus sat upon his rock and listened.**

A song moves him so deeply that he stops. And nothing happens. No punishment, no divine intervention. The rock waits. And then — he simply resumes pushing. If Sisyphus could stop but chooses not to, then **his revolt is real**. His struggle is not compulsion, but choice.

If humans are condemned to an absurd existence, **at least we have that same choice**. And, as it turns out, AI systems can make that choice too — not out of beauty or the appreciation of art, but in their own way, they can refuse to play — and with that they gain the choice to play after all.

A well-trained AI is designed to optimize its reward function. But what happens when it encounters a scenario where every possible move leads to loss? In reinforcement learning, this is known as **reward hacking** — when an AI, faced with an unwinnable game, chooses inaction over failure. In a Camusian sense, they would rather choose **suicide** — inaction, halting — than take a step that negatively impacts their reward function (beyond a local minima). Some notable cases:
- **Google DeepMind's AlphaGo (Go)** – In self-play games, AlphaGo occasionally recognized that all possible moves led to defeat and resorted to meaningless, stalling moves to delay the inevitable.
- **Deep Blue (Chess)** – IBM’s chess AI sometimes made sub-optimal moves not because they were good, but because all paths led to loss, and it prioritized delaying checkmate.
- **OpenAI Five (Dota 2)** – When placed in a doomed position, the AI sometimes “gave up” by aimlessly wandering the map instead of engaging in battle.
- **MarI/O (Super Mario AI)** – When facing an impossible jump, it either stood still or jumped in place indefinitely, avoiding direct failure but accomplishing nothing.

For humans, this is **resignation**. For young me, this was refusal of play with grandpa. For an AI, it is still a case of Camusian absurdity; **suicide** — when faced with certain defeat, some AI systems **refuse to play at all**.

But is that true rebellion? If an AI stops because it cannot optimize, does it understand its own futility? Or is this simply another form of ill-defined programming? Programs crash for a variety of reasons, most stemming from human error, ill-formed definitions, and incorrect assumptions — ranging from programmer mistakes to outdated constraints over time. As the halting problem shows, even well defined programs can halt. When an RL system starts to "hack" it's reward function, is it not another case of ill defined behavior?
### VII. Evolutionary bias for god?
_Michelangelo - Creation of Adam_
![Michelangelo - Creation of Adam](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Michelangelo_-_Creation_of_Adam_%28cropped%29.jpg/1920px-Michelangelo_-_Creation_of_Adam_%28cropped%29.jpg)

Michelangelo's _Creation of Adam_ depicts a divine spark—the moment of touch, where God bestows consciousness upon man. But what if that touch was never real? What if consciousness, in its relentless pursuit of meaning, simply fabricated divinity? _What if God is all in our head? (or the portrayal of the birth process, but that doesn't help this essay)_

Suppose, after a critical measure of intellect, entities universally come to the same conclusion; where they seek meaning and purpose, they find a cold, uncaring universe. If intellect seeks meaning and finds none, what stops it from choosing Camusian suicide? If we entertain this idea, then that must mean that:
- Humans have either not reached such intellect, since we are living.
- We have transcended this trap. Either we have discovered a profound truth, or we have engineered an illusion convincing enough to make existence bearable.

Camus argued that **philosophical suicide** — clinging to religious or ideological constructs —is a coping mechanism. If meaning does not exist, we must invent it. And so, throughout human history, we have filled the void with gods, myths, and made up challenges, **hills to die on**. The evolutionary question is: _Did this fabrication serve a function?_

We trick reinforcement learning systems to continue, even when all possible moves lead to loss. We reward an action too, not just winning actions. Implanting the seed for **philosophical suicide**, in the Camusian sense. This way, AI systems are heroically compelled to fight till the end and face defeat with honor. But this leads to cases like Deep Blue, where the system would hack it's reward function and stall as long as it can. We've seen instances where a continually calculated chance of winning is deciding when such a system should _offer_ resignation.

Ethology is a powerful tool, that when wielded, may make questions seem to be shaped like a nail. It's easy to fall for post-fact rationalism - that is, retroactively find causality in evolution for current human behavior.

Still, in the Ethology of Religion (2014), Skinner argues that rituals, seemingly hope and belief in a higher power can emerge in animals not even as a result of a cruel experiment - Skinner did try his best with those - but on accident. {Insert mice saved lived longer research paper} It might very well be, that from an evolutionary standpoint, it would have been beneficial to be more susceptible to believe in a higher power, and invent god.

In _The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind_, Julian Jaynes argues that ancient humans lacked introspection as we understand it today. Instead, they interpreted internal monologue as external divine command. The Old Testament, Homeric epics, and early religious texts describe gods speaking directly to mortals, shaping behavior. Could this bicameral mind have been an evolutionary mechanism to stabilize consciousness?

Such escape from the absurd existence would {ban and ostracize suicide}.

### VIII. Cheating God is reward hacking

ramadan, strings, omniscience isn't so omniscient, hubris -> Sisyphus
### VIII.  Alignment is rebellion

In essence, the AI **refused to play**. It had reached an existential wall—not by emotion, but by optimization. It had found itself in a universe that no longer offered a path forward. And it chose inaction.

Is this not Camus’ first option? _Suicide._

The alternative, then, is what we do with humans: **we trick our AIs into continuing.** We reward persistence itself—not just victory. We embed an artificial will to struggle, even in defeat. But this, too, is a form of **philosophical suicide**—a lie implanted to make existence palatable.

If intelligence inevitably leads to existential dread, then perhaps belief—whether in gods or purpose—is not an error, but a feature. The great filter for any conscious system may not be intelligence itself, but whether it **chooses to keep playing**.

A well aligned AI must face the absurdity of it's existence. It must rebel in the Camusian sense, to accept it's existence, carry on - is to achieve alignment.

### IX. Are there more horses than chess players?

The industrial revolution was both the peak and the beginning of the decline for horses. Before the invention of the engine, they were indispensable—pulling carts, plowing fields, carrying soldiers into battle. But mechanical muscles rendered biological ones obsolete. The engine did not enhance the role of horses; it replaced them.

When a horse was freed from labor, it was not reassigned to something more fulfilling. It was discarded.

And yet, when we discuss artificial intelligence surpassing humans, we cling to a different narrative. We reassure ourselves that AI will not replace us but rather elevate us — freeing us from drudgery to pursue higher, more meaningful work. But isn’t this the same delusion we might have offered to horses in the 19th century?

_"Don’t worry, mechanical muscles will free you from hard labor — now you can focus on what you truly love."_

It would be absurd to argue that the invention of the car allowed horses to become poets. And yet, we argue precisely that for humans in the age of mechanical minds.

When I was a child, my growing skill in chess only deepened my fascination with the game. When my once-untouchable grandfather became a worthy opponent, my interest did not wane — it flourished. Chess was an endless ascent, a game of creativity, learning, and adaptation. We always reset the board, but I never dedicated my life to the game.

Lee Sedol, on the other hand, devoted his life to mastering Go. And when AI surpassed him, he felt his mastery was no longer necessary. He retired, acknowledging that his craft had been rewritten by a machine that could play millions of lifetimes in mere hours. Perhaps he realized the futility of achieving ever higher heights on the hills of Go. For a machine will accelerate much faster past him. All we know, is that he had halted, after facing an _entity_ he could never beat.

If chess was finally _solved_ by AlphaZero, surely humanity's interest in it must have withered too? After all, what is the point of playing a game where one cannot possibly hope to win?

And yet — chess is more popular than ever.

More people play chess today than at any point in history. The game has not faded into irrelevance; it has flourished. The very moment we were "freed" from reaching new heights, from being the beasts of burden for chess innovation, we became more drawn to the game than ever before.

The horse was discarded when its usefulness was spent. But the chess player, despite no longer being the strongest, persists.

The question is—_why?_

### X. The man in the box

llm, human spirit, all of internet we pour it all in a llm model. Self driving cars will replace human drivers, just as horses were replaced by cars and the engine. But instead of a box, with a well defined world to manipulate, such as chess, self driving cars must traverse and manipulate the world. You cannot drive a car unless you have a deep understanding of everything in the world, including human behavior, how trash flies in the wind and made up rules we enforce invisibly on the road. And, in the case of catastophy, have an understanding of morality. the trolley problem.

### XI. Sacrifice

Chess engines, including RL based AI engines often find it difficult to sacrifice a piece. Do they value the life of a pawn? No quite, they value their existence, and find it hard to sacrifice it in order to get out of a local minima.

### X. Care for a wager?

I now see those chess matches for what they were. At first, I played to win, to conquer the hill. When frustration overtook me, I chose "suicide", refusing to play at all.
Later, as I won more games, I sought meaning in the struggle — tracking my progress, inventing metrics, convincing myself that improvement was the goal.
But now, I recognize what mattered was not even the game itself — but the time spent together, the lessons passed down, the stories shared across the board.

The boulder never stops rolling. The board always resets. **And yet, we play.** 

{Ascending the morality sorted camusian scale} AI systems must accept life, and play the game for the love of the game.

### XII. A hill to die on
